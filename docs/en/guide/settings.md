# Basic Settings
## Server Core
::: danger Warning
Please avoid excessive machine density. Thank you for your cooperation!
:::
**This server uses the [Leave](https://GitHub.com/LeavesMC/Leaves) core.** <br>
**Most vanilla features are enabled.** <br>

## No Item Drop on Death
**We have enabled no item drop on death.**
<!--## Item Drop on Death
::: warning Note
Unlike vanilla, dropped items will despawn after 3 minutes!
:::
**Please note, we have not enabled no item drop on death. Try to avoid dying, and if you do, quickly retrieve your items!**-->

## Sleep System
**We do not use a sleep acceleration mechanism but instead employ a custom sleep system using the [NoPhantomSleep](https://GitHub.com/SkydomGroup/NoPhantomSleep) plugin. The specifics are as follows: as long as you right-click a bed at night and sleep for more than 5 seconds, it will count as having passed the entire night. No phantoms will spawn within a 64-block radius around you, and this effect lasts for 30 minutes.** <br>

## View Distance
**Our view distance is set to 16 chunks.**
<!--## Entity Spawning
**Although we've reduced the view distance and entity calculation range, we've significantly increased the mob spawn rate in chunks near players.**-->

## Land Claim
**The tool for creating land claims is set to a wooden hoe. The maximum claim size is 512×512 (X×Z), with no height limit (-64~328 is allowed).**
